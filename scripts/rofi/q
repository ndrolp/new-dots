       wofi - A rofi inspired launcher for wlroots compositors

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mwofi [22m[options]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mwofi  [22mis a rofi inspired menu program for wlroots compositors such as sway. It is intended to be highly customizable and flexible with the help of CSS styling and a dmenu mode that
       allows for endless scriptability. Wofi can be run cacheless in dmenu mode automatically by invoking it as dmenu with symlink.

       Wofi was designed specifically for wlroots and makes use of the wlr-layer-shell protocol. If your compositor does not support this protocol or if you are in a non-wayland  environ‚Äê
       ment then wofi must be run with [1m--normal-window [22mor it will crash. If you wish to run wofi this way you can also place [1mnormal_window=true [22min your config file to avoid specifying the
       option on the command line.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m
       Wofi has 3 main files used for configuration. All files are completely optional.

       1.  The config file which defaults to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wofi/config.

       2.  The CSS file which defaults to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wofi/style.css.

       3.  The colors file which defaults to the pywal cache $XDG_CACHE_HOME/wal/colors.

       All 3 of these paths can be manually specified using the respective command line flag. In the case of the last 2 they can additionally be specified in the config file.

       In the event $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not specified it defaults to ~/.config likewise if $XDG_CACHE_HOME is not specified it defaults to ~/.cache.

       Information about the formats for these files can be found in [1mwofi[22m(5).
